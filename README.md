# ShellCrypt

A text editor that aims to provide a layer of security with one-time-pad encryption and an option to choose from one of four customizable themes: Beach, Lagoon, Desert and Multi Color.  

Hopes to incorporate the author's intent of being mindful of both the ethics and aesthetics of textual activity.

Made with <3 using vanilla python and Tkinter.
